# Image Classification using ANN & CNN

## 📸 Project Overview
This project focuses on **image classification** using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. Two models, **ANN** and **CNN**, are trained on **32x32 color images** spanning **10 different classes**. The dataset undergoes **preprocessing**, after which the models are built, trained, and evaluated.

---
## 🚀 Features
- 🔹 **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** implementation
- 🔹 **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** implementation
- 🔹 Utilizes **TensorFlow** and **Keras**
- 🔹 CIFAR-10 dataset for multi-class classification
- 🔹 Model evaluation & visualization with **Matplotlib**

---
## 📂 Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of **60,000 images** (50,000 for training, 10,000 for testing) classified into:
🔹 Airplane ✈️  
🔹 Automobile 🚗  
🔹 Bird 🐦  
🔹 Cat 🐱  
🔹 Deer 🦌  
🔹 Dog 🐶  
🔹 Frog 🐸  
🔹 Horse 🐴  
🔹 Ship 🚢  
🔹 Truck 🚛

## 🖥 GUI Preview
An **interactive GUI** is included for testing the model with custom images.

### 🔹 Features
- Upload an image for classification
- Get real-time predictions
- Compare ANN vs CNN performance

## 📊 Model Performance
The models are trained and evaluated based on **accuracy and loss metrics**.

| Model | Accuracy (Test) |
|--------|------------|
| ANN | 65% |
| CNN | 85% |
